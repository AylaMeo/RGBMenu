# RGB Menu

## This project hasn't been updated since 2019, I very much doubt it still works in FiveM and you probably shouldn't use it since it has been slowly breaking even when I was still interested in caring about it. It doesn't need updates it needs a complete re-write so please don't try to start updating it.

### **About**

A simple menu to change primary and secondary paint based on RGB.

Also can modify neons and do cool neon tricks.

**If you have any ideas for neon modes, please suggest them**
